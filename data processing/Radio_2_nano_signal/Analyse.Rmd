## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
delays = read.csv("UT2Nano.csv",header = TRUE)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
gf_histogram(~Time, data=delays, bins=10, xlab="Obseved delays [us]")
fav_stats(delays$Time)
gf_boxplot(~Time, data=delays)
result <- t.test(delays$Time)
print(result$conf.int)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
S_1 = 30.63973
S_2 = 51.14
f_obs = (S_1^2)/(S_2^2)

pdist("f", f_obs, df1=99, df2=776)
```
